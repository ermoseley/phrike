I'll add a minimal-spacing based CFL for Legendre grids and re-enable adaptive stepping using that as the initial dt. I'll compute dx_min/dy_min in Grid2D and use them in SpectralSolver2D.compute_dt. Then I'll switch the config back to adaptive=true.


Short answer: the main culprit is CFL underestimation on the Legendre grid, compounded by missing energy-stable boundary treatment for non-periodic Legendre in 2D.

What I see in the code:
- CFL error for Legendre: compute_dt used L/N spacings. On Legendre LGL nodes, min spacing is O(œÄ^2/N^2) near endpoints, so the stable dt is ~100√ó smaller than using L/N. I‚Äôve added dx_min/dy_min to Grid2D and changed compute_dt to use min(dx_min, dy_min); adaptive is re-enabled. You can see dt ~ 4e-5 now.
- No proper boundary treatment in 2D Legendre: we‚Äôre doing strong-form collocation (D¬∑F) without SAT/numerical fluxes and we removed manual BC enforcement. For Euler with walls/outflow this is not energy-stable and blows up quickly even with a correct dt.
- Aliasing/split form: nonlinear fluxes on collocation grids alias; we have modal filtering, but no split-form/flux-differencing. That further destabilizes Legendre compared to periodic Fourier KHI.
- Monitoring uses plain sums; on Legendre, integrals should be quadrature-weighted. The huge ‚Äúmass_error‚Äù is not meaningful.

Minimal fixes to stabilize:
- Keep adaptive, but use min node spacing (done). Consider smaller cfl (0.02‚Äì0.05) initially.
- Enforce BCs every RK substage for Legendre:
  - Bottom: v=0; recompute energy from p and u at the wall row.
  - Top/sides: zero-gradient copy.
- Strengthen Legendre modal filtering each step and add a tiny constant viscosity.
- Optionally add a light sponge in the top 10‚Äì15% to stabilize the outflow.

Longer-term correct fix:
- Switch to SBP-SAT or split-form/flux-differencing for 2D Legendre so boundaries and nonlinearity are energy-stable.

I looked through the RTI path and the new 2D Legendre integration. Here are the most likely causes of the rapid blow-up, in order of impact:

- Critical CFL mis-estimation for Legendre grid
  - compute_dt uses grid.dx = Lx/Nx and grid.dy = Ly/Ny, but Legendre nodes are clustered near boundaries; the true minimum spacing is O(L/N^2). With Nx=64, Ny=128, the smallest Œîy is ~2/128^2 ‚âà 1.2e-4, but we‚Äôre stepping like Œîy ‚âà 1/64 ‚âà 1.6e-2, exceeding the stable CFL by ~100x at the endpoints.
  - Fix: In the 2D solver, compute dt with min(np.diff(grid.x)) and min(np.diff(grid.y)) instead of L/N. Start with smaller cfl (e.g., 0.02‚Äì0.05) for Legendre.

- Missing energy-stable boundary treatment for non-periodic Legendre
  - The 2D Legendre path applies plain nodal derivatives (D¬∑F) with no SAT/numerical flux at boundaries. For Euler, this is not energy stable and will blow up quickly with outflow/wall BCs.
  - KHI works because Fourier is periodic, no boundaries to treat.
  - Minimal stopgap: enforce BCs each RK stage (bottom v=0; copy ghost values for Neumann), and recompute energy consistently after enforcing the wall condition. Proper fix requires SBP-SAT/flux differencing.

- Aliasing/nonlinear stability in Legendre
  - The Euler nonlinear fluxes alias on a collocation grid; Fourier has 2/3-rule dealiasing, but we don‚Äôt have an equivalent for Legendre. Modal filtering helps, but without split-form/flux-differencing it‚Äôs still fragile.
  - Mitigate: stronger modal filtering every stage and/or a small constant viscosity. Longer-term: skew-symmetric/split-form flux or flux-differencing.

- Monitoring is misleading with Legendre
  - Conservation metrics (mass, energy) are computed as simple sums. On Legendre grids, integrals should use quadrature weights; current mass_error prints are not trustworthy and can look astronomical even if fields are finite.
  - Fix: when basis is Legendre, weight sums by tensor-product LGL weights.

- Gravity/ICs are not the primary culprit
  - The hydrostatic ICs integrate dp/dy = œÅ gy correctly for the given œÅ(y). The immediate instability and NaNs trace to the two issues above (CFL and boundary/numerical stability), not to the ICs or gravity source.

What I‚Äôd change first, minimally:
- In 2D dt calculation, use Œîx_min = min(diff(grid.x)), Œîy_min = min(diff(grid.y)).
- Reintroduce BC enforcement each RHS/RK stage for the Legendre grid (bottom reflective, top/sides Neumann), including consistent energy recomputation at the wall.
- Strengthen modal filter (alpha 100+, p 8‚Äì10, every step) and optionally add tiny constant viscosity.
- Lower cfl to 0.02‚Äì0.05 for Legendre until we implement SAT/flux-differencing.

If you want, I can implement the corrected dt for Legendre grids and re-add per-stage BC enforcement now.
