Add new basis functions
    - Chebyshev + Filtering near discontinuities
Compare our Chebyshev/Legendre implementation to Dedalus. What aren't we getting right, if anything?
Run a convection problem. Set pressure BCs for a stratified medium.
Compare Dedalus to PHRIKE


After the fork:
Add turbulent driving
Add MPI
Add MHD

Install PyTorch with CUDA support:
Apply to chebyshev_so...
cu118
Consider using float32 for large problems:
Modify the grid initialization to use torch.float32 instead of torch.float64
This would roughly double the effective memory and speed
Enable multi-GPU support (future enhancement):
The current architecture could be extended for multi-GPU simulations
PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel could be integrated
Optimize FFT operations:
Consider using cuFFT directly for even better performance
Batch multiple FFT operations when possible


Longer term:
Upgrade to spectral element method (SEM)
