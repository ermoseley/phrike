CONCLUSIONS
----------
1. Adaptive time-stepping shows efficiency improvements across
   all 1D test problems.
2. Step count reductions vary depending on problem characteristics.
3. Conservation properties are maintained or improved with adaptive
   time-stepping.
4. The adaptive methods successfully handle varying time scales
   automatically without manual tuning.
5. The implementation maintains full backward compatibility with
   existing fixed time-stepping configurations.
