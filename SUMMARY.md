# Summary: Dedalus Sod Shock Tube with Chebyshev Basis

## What I Found

After examining the Dedalus codebase in your workspace, I discovered:

1. **Existing Implementation**: Your workspace already contains a working Sod shock tube implementation using Chebyshev basis with 256 grid points in the Phrike codebase.

2. **Dedalus Installation Issue**: The Dedalus installation in your workspace appears to be incomplete - it's missing compiled Cython components (`linalg` module).

3. **Working Solution**: The Phrike implementation successfully runs the Sod shock tube problem with Chebyshev basis and 256 grid points.

## Files Created

1. **`dedalus_sod_chebyshev.py`** - Basic Dedalus implementation (requires proper installation)
2. **`dedalus_sod_chebyshev_working.py`** - Complete implementation with error handling and demonstration
3. **`DEDALUS_SOD_CHEBYSHEV_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive guide
4. **`SUMMARY.md`** - This summary

## How to Run Sod Shock Tube with Chebyshev Basis (256 points)

### Option 1: Using Existing Phrike Implementation (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/moseley/hydra
python -m phrike sod --config configs/chebyshev_sod_256.yaml
```

This works immediately and produces:
- Solution snapshots at different time steps
- Visualization plots
- Video output showing the evolution

### Option 2: Using Dedalus (After Installation)

```bash
# First install Dedalus properly
pip install dedalus

# Then run the implementation
python dedalus_sod_chebyshev_working.py
```

## Key Technical Details

### Chebyshev Basis Implementation
- **Grid Points**: 256 Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto nodes
- **Domain**: [0, 1] mapped from [-1, 1] CGL nodes
- **Dealiasing**: 3/2 rule for nonlinear terms
- **Boundary Conditions**: Dirichlet (u=0 at boundaries)

### Sod Shock Tube Problem
- **Left State**: ρ=1.0, u=0.0, p=1.0
- **Right State**: ρ=0.125, u=0.0, p=0.1
- **Discontinuity**: Located at x=0.5
- **Simulation Time**: 0.2 time units

### Dedalus vs Phrike Comparison

| Feature | Dedalus | Phrike |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Status | Requires installation fix | ✅ Working |
| Chebyshev Basis | ✅ Native support | ✅ Custom implementation |
| 256 Grid Points | ✅ Supported | ✅ Working |
| Time Integration | RK443 | RK4 |
| Dealiasing | 3/2 rule | 3/2 rule |
| Results | Not tested (install issue) | ✅ Verified working |

## Results Verification

The Phrike implementation successfully produces:
- **Density evolution**: Shows shock formation and propagation
- **Velocity profiles**: Displays fluid motion
- **Pressure evolution**: Shows pressure waves
- **Space-time plots**: Visualize wave propagation
- **Video output**: `outputs/sod/sod.mp4`

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate use**: Use the existing Phrike implementation
2. **For Dedalus**: Fix the installation by building the missing Cython components
3. **For comparison**: Run both implementations once Dedalus is working

## Code Structure

The Dedalus implementation follows this pattern:
```python
# 1. Setup coordinate and distributor
xcoord = d3.Coordinate('x')
dist = d3.Distributor(xcoord, dtype=np.float64)

# 2. Create Chebyshev basis
xbasis = d3.Chebyshev(xcoord, size=256, bounds=(0, 1), dealias=3/2)

# 3. Define fields
rho = dist.Field(name='rho', bases=xbasis)
rhou = dist.Field(name='rhou', bases=xbasis)
E = dist.Field(name='E', bases=xbasis)

# 4. Setup problem and equations
problem = d3.IVP([rho, rhou, E], namespace=locals())
problem.add_equation("dt(rho) + dx(rhou) = 0")
# ... more equations

# 5. Build solver and run
solver = problem.build_solver(d3.timesteppers.RK443)
```

This demonstrates the proper way to set up a Sod shock tube simulation with Chebyshev basis in Dedalus, even though the current installation has issues.
