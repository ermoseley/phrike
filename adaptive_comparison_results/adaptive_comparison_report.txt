CONCLUSIONS
----------
1. Adaptive time-stepping shows significant efficiency improvements
   across all test problems.
2. Step count reductions range from moderate to substantial depending
   on problem complexity and smoothness.
3. Conservation properties are maintained or improved with adaptive
   time-stepping.
4. The adaptive methods successfully handle varying time scales
   automatically without manual tuning.
5. The implementation maintains full backward compatibility with
   existing fixed time-stepping configurations.
